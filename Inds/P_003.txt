 are essentially those due to unutilized kinetic energy in the exhaust stream and
 the unavailable energy fundamental to thermodynamics. The diagram in Fig. 3.2
 illustrates the energy balance.
 3.3 The Propulsive Efficiency
 In evolving this definition, input fuel energy is not considered. The output which
 is the propulsive effect is divided by the output plus the unutilized kinetic energy
 of the exhaust stream. (This is defined in terms of power). The power due to the
 propulsive effect is FVa, where Va is the flight speed of the vehicle carrying the
 propulsive unit. The losses in the jet are estimated to be ma(Ve Va)2 / 2 since
 Veis the velocity of the jet relative to the propulsive unit, and (Ve Va)2/2 the
 kinetic energy per unit mass flow rate of the jet. Thus,
 Thrust Power = FVa

 The expression for the power lost can also be written as F (Ve - Va)/2, if we note
 that F = ma(Ve Va); thus, the propulsive efficiency (p) can be written down as
 (3.5)
 where T = Va/Ve. The above expression for propulsive efficiency is valid for all air
 breathing engines with rinf / ma = f<K 1. Typical values of f for turbojets, turbo-
 prop and turbofans will be around 0.005 0.02. Only in the case of a ramjet or an
 after-burning turbojet, f is about 0.067, the stoichiometric value for a kerosene-
 air system. Even in this case the above expression is approximately valid. The
 expression that allows for non-zero f can be obtained as
 (3.6)
 It is useful to obtain the order of magnitude of the power usefully spent and lost.
 For a typical operating condition like F = 70 kN, Va = 800 km/hr (222 m/s), Ve =
 522 m/s,
 Useful power = FVa = 15.5MW
