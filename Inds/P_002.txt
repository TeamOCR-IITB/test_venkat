 In the case of a non-airbreathing engine (a rocket engine), the expression for
 One of the classical design conditions for the rocket nozzle is Pe = Pas since this
 ensures complete expansion. For an operational rocket, the change in altitude
 during the flight affects the second term. However, the second term is very small
 or negligible as compared to the first term. In fact, in the worst operating off-
 design conditions, the magnitude of the second term does not exceed 10 % in the
 case of rocket engines. This is not true in the case of air breathing engines always.
 In the analysis to follow, the second term will be ignored for simplicity for rocket
 Efficiencies can be defined as output/ (output + losses) or output / input. It
 must be understood that these two definitions have indeed different implications.
 Both these definitions will be used below. The losses can be several. Transmission
 and other mechanical losses are ignored for the present. The losses accounted for
 refers to the cross sectional area ofthe nozzle exit.
