 Thus, the enormous power oft the propulsion system and also that lost in thejet
 can be noted. Propulsive efficiencies ofthe order of 60 % are considered reasonable
 from an overall operation point of view. If we put the expressions for thrust and
 propulsive efficiency together we obtain,

 3.4 Further Analysis
 Figure 3.3 shows a plot of both F/(maVe) and Tp with T. If T > 1, the developed
 thrust is negative. Thus, for an air breathing engine T < 1. The maximum effi-
 ciency is obtained at T = 1, at which Tp = 1 and F = 0. Apparently, the propulsive
 units are most efficient when they do no work!. How do we interpret this situation
 in actual practice? In order to obtain a non-zero thrust and have a high propulsive
