 Chapter 3
 The Eiliciencies ofPropulsion
 Systems
 3.1 Introduction
 In this chapter we treat the propulsive, thermal and overall efficiencies of propul-
 sion systems. As different from these, there are efficiencies related to components
 like diffuser, compressor, combustor, turbine and nozzle which will be discussed
 subsequently. The use of propulsive and related efficiencies is limited to obtaining
 an appreciation of the speed range in which a given propulsion system is most
 efficient. It must be understood that these efficiencies alone do not dominate the
 choice of a system in a specific speed range and other aspects of the mission are
 very important. In fact, specific aspects of the mission are SO over-riding that these
 efficiencies (propulsive or overall) become irrelevant. Nevertheless, much can be
 learnt about the efficiency or inefficiency of an operating system by examining it
 in the light ofthese definitions.
 3.2 Analysis
 In the analysis to follow, the propulsive system is treated as a black box that en-
 hances the exit momentum flow in relation to that of the inlet by introducing en-
 ergy generated by combustion. Figures 3.1, a and b show the specific features of
 The important distinction between the air breathing and non-air breathing
 engines is that while air is ingested in the case of air breathing engines, no free
 stream flow is ingested into the engine in the case of non-air breathing engines.
 The expression for thrust for an air breathing engine can be written following
 such a system for air breathing and non-air breathing engines.
